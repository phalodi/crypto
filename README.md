# crypto
In this repo we have 2 crypto algorithms caesar and vigenere in c language.

How to run these programs-
1.you need to download cs50.h library because it uses GetString() from it.
2.compile the program 
3. now run program like ./caesar key or ./vigenere key (key is encryption key for example ./caesar 4 or ./vigenere xyz)
4. now there is a prompt so enter the data which you want to encrypt
5. finally your data is encrypted
